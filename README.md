A first attempt at an evolution based method the tune the weights of a neural network for entities that follow moving points

Hotkeys can be seen in the code or are as follows;
1 = low poly mode (faster to compute generations in this)
2   = Speed down 
3   = Speed up
4 = show graph (# of successful entities on a given generation)
5 = toggle score overlay

situations can also be set at the start of the program and are as follows;
1 = regular speed, from start
2 = variable speed, from start
3 = regular speed, from given generation (has a load screen at start)
